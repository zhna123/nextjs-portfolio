The Developer's Journal is a multi-faceted project featuring two frontend applications built with Next.js, both interacting with a common Express RESTful API. These applications serve distinct purposes. The first frontend app allows visitors to view blog posts and leave comments. The second frontend app enables the author to create, edit, and manage blog posts, providing efficient tools for managing articles.

This project provided me with an opportunity to create a content management system, and gave me experience designing, developing, and hosting a RESTful api for different frontends to consume.

- Separation of concerns - host backend/DB and frontend on different servers.
- Handling CORS from backend and frontend.
- I've used Next.js, learning about Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Pre-rendering with SSG and SSR.
