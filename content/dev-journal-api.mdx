The Developer's Journal RESTful Blog API provides endpoints for viewing, commenting, as well as creating and editing blog posts. 
It is a multi-faceted project featuring two frontend apps built with Next.js, both interacting with the API.

While working on this project, I practiced designing, developing, and hosting a RESTful API for different frontends to consume.

- Separation of concerns - host backend/DB and frontend on different servers.
- RESTful API design.
- JWT authentication.
- Handling CORS from backend and frontend.
