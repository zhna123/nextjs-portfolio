This project incorporated new features from Next.js and react, including app router and server actions.

After the user chooses a schedule to set, a form pops open for them to enter the time. 
- The popup modal is implemented using search params to take advantage of server-side rendering.
- The form submission is handled by server actions, which eliminates the need for creating API endpoints, and ensures data security.
