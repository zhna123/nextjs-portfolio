A web app simulates the beloved "Where's Waldo" game. Although this is one of my first react based projects, it provided valuable insights and learning experiences.

- Frontend development with React allowed me to grasp fundamental concepts such as JSX, component, hooks, props and state management.
- I utilized Firebase as the backend, providing game data storage. This introduced me to cloud-based solutions and serverless architecture.
- Simulating the game required me to implement the core game logic, including image analysis, player interaction, and scoring mechanisms.
