The Orbit Talk Web App's frontend was constructed with React, Vite, 
and Typescript, the backend used ExpressJS and MongoDB to create a 
RESTful API. User authentication relied on JWT, so the authenticated 
user can perform actions such as profile editing, password updates, 
and friend management, alongside the primary feature of exchanging 
messages with friends.

While Orbit Talk may not have featured real-time messaging capabilities, 
it provided me with valuable learning experiences and opportunities to 
develop essential skills.

- Utilized React, Vite, and Typescript to build the app's user interface, I gained proficiency in these web development tools.
- On the backend, I designed DB model, used mongoDB for data storage, and created RESTful API with ExpressJS, which improved my understanding on server side development.
- Implementing JWT authentication enhanced my knowledge of user security measures in web applications.
- I've learned and implemented Router testing with Jest and supertest for the API endpoints unit testing.
- Through frontend testing, I gained familiarity with Vitest and React Testing Library.
- I attempted to maintain a focus on accessibility for the app and learned more about web accessibility.
- I also practiced project organization, task management, and version control throughout the development.
